> [!NOTE]
> Sections 1–14 describe the original 2D ECG image-classification phase of the project. These methods were useful for transfer-learning experimentation and leakage auditing, but the final clinically interpretable pipeline moved to PTB-XL-only raw 1D ECG signals because the combined image dataset contained a source-label confound.

## 1. Pipeline Architecture Overview

The complete system follows a two-phase transfer learning paradigm with deterministic evaluation.

## 2. Transfer Learning: Mathematical Foundations

### 2.1 The Core Idea

Transfer learning exploits the fact that convolutional features learned on a large source domain $\mathcal{D}_S$ (ImageNet, 14M images, 1000 classes) can be reused on a small target domain $\mathcal{D}_T$ (928 ECG images, 2 classes).

Formally, let $f_\theta$ be a CNN parameterized by $\theta$. We decompose it into:

$$f_\theta(x) = g_{\theta_h}(\phi_{\theta_b}(x))$$

where:
- $\phi_{\theta_b}: \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times 3} \to \mathbb{R}^d$ is the **backbone** (feature extractor), with parameters $\theta_b$ pretrained on ImageNet
- $g_{\theta_h}: \mathbb{R}^d \to [0,1]$ is the **classification head**, with parameters $\theta_h$ randomly initialized

> **Why it works:** Yosinski et al. (2014) showed that early CNN layers learn general features (edges, textures, gradients) that transfer across domains, while later layers learn task-specific features. For medical images, the low-level features (lines, curves, contrast patterns) are directly applicable to ECG waveform recognition.

### 2.2 Two-Phase Fine-Tuning Protocol

**Phase 1 — Head Training (Feature Extraction):**

$$\min_{\theta_h} \mathcal{L}(\theta_b^{\text{frozen}}, \theta_h; \mathcal{D}_T)$$

Only $\theta_h$ is updated. The backbone $\theta_b$ remains at ImageNet values. This prevents catastrophic forgetting — the destruction of pretrained features by large gradients from a randomly initialized head.

**Phase 2 — Partial Fine-Tuning:**

$$\min_{\theta_h, \theta_b^{\text{top}}} \mathcal{L}(\theta_b^{\text{bottom, frozen}}, \theta_b^{\text{top}}, \theta_h; \mathcal{D}_T)$$

The top $k$ layers of $\theta_b$ are unfrozen with a very small learning rate ($10^{-5}$), allowing them to adapt to ECG-specific patterns while preserving general features in the lower layers.

## 3. Model Backbones: EfficientNetB0 vs. DenseNet121

### 3.1 EfficientNetB0 and Compound Scaling

EfficientNet (Tan & Le, 2019) introduced **compound scaling** — simultaneously scaling network depth $d$, width $w$, and resolution $r$ under a fixed resource constraint:

$$d = \alpha^\phi, \quad w = \beta^\phi, \quad r = \gamma^\phi$$

subject to:

$$\alpha \cdot \beta^2 \cdot \gamma^2 \approx 2$$

where $\phi$ is a user-specified compound coefficient. For EfficientNetB0 ($\phi = 1$): $\alpha = 1.2$, $\beta = 1.1$, $\gamma = 1.15$, with native input resolution **224 × 224**.

### 3.2 DenseNet121 and Feature Reuse

DenseNet121 (Huang et al., 2017) introduces direct shortcuts between any two layers with the same feature-map size. Instead of drawing features from a single preceding layer, each layer obtains inputs from all preceding layers:

$$\mathbf{x}_l = H_l([\mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{x}_1, \dots, \mathbf{x}_{l-1}])$$

where $[\mathbf{x}_0, \mathbf{x}_1, \dots, \mathbf{x}_{l-1}]$ represents the concatenation of feature maps produced in layers $0, 1, \dots, l-1$. 

### 3.3 Backbone Rationale for ECG Image Classification

| Metric/Factor | EfficientNetB0 | DenseNet121 |
|---|---|---|
| **Parameters** | 5.3 Million | 7.2 Million |
| **Feature Propagation** | Sequential inverted bottlenecks (MBConv blocks) | Direct dense connections (Feature concatenation) |
| **Grid/Waveform Inductive Bias** | Squeeze-and-excitation pools global features. | Dense connections propagate thin waveforms directly without degradation. |
| **Observed internal AUC before source-confound resolution** | 0.7485 | 0.8005 (Standard BCE) / 0.7920 (Focal Loss) |

DenseNet121 is highly suitable for ECG plots since thin gridlines and waveform strokes are easily lost in deep bottleneck layers. The dense connectivity preserves these high-frequency geometric patterns down to the final classification head.

## 4. Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy, Label Smoothing, and Focal Loss

### 4.1 Standard Binary Cross-Entropy

For binary classification with ground truth $y \in \{0, 1\}$ and predicted probability $\hat{y} = \sigma(z) \in (0, 1)$:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{BCE}}(y, \hat{y}) = -\left[ y \log(\hat{y}) + (1 - y) \log(1 - \hat{y}) \right]$$

where $\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$ is the sigmoid function applied to the logit $z$.

### 4.2 Label Smoothing

Label smoothing (Szegedy et al., 2016) replaces hard labels $y \in \{0, 1\}$ with soft labels:

$$y_{\text{smooth}} = y \cdot (1 - \epsilon) + \frac{\epsilon}{2}$$

For $\epsilon = 0.1$:
- Hard label 1 → soft label **0.95**
- Hard label 0 → soft label **0.05**

The smoothed loss becomes:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{smooth}} = -\left[ y_{\text{smooth}} \log(\hat{y}) + (1 - y_{\text{smooth}}) \log(1 - \hat{y}) \right]$$

**Why it helps:**
1. **Prevents overconfidence:** The model cannot drive logits to $\pm\infty$, which acts as implicit regularization.
2. **Improves calibration:** On small datasets, hard labels encourage memorization. Soft labels encourage the model to output probabilities closer to the true posterior.

### 4.3 Focal Loss

To address class imbalance and focus on hard examples, Focal Loss (Lin et al., 2017) introduces a dynamically scaling modulating factor $(1 - p_t)^\gamma$ to standard cross-entropy.

Define $p_t$ as:

$$p_t = \begin{cases} \hat{y} & \text{if } y = 1 \\ 1 - \hat{y} & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

The standard cross-entropy can be rewritten as $\text{CE}(p_t) = -\log(p_t)$. Focal Loss is formulated as:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{Focal}}(p_t) = -\alpha_t (1 - p_t)^\gamma \log(p_t)$$

where:
*   $\gamma \geq 0$ is the **focusing parameter** that down-weights easy examples, forcing the model to concentrate gradients on hard boundary examples. In this project, we set $\gamma = 2.0$.
*   $\alpha_t \in [0, 1]$ is the **balancing parameter** that handles the baseline class imbalance (Normal vs. Abnormal). In this project, we set $\alpha = 0.25$ for class 1 (Abnormal) and $0.75$ for class 0 (Normal).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The focal-loss α values described here apply to the early imbalanced 2D image experiments. In the final balanced PTB-XL 1D dataset, the model used balanced focal loss with α=0.5 and no class weights to avoid introducing artificial positive-class bias.

**Why it helps:**
1. **Gradient Concentration:** When an example is correctly classified ($p_t \approx 1$), the modulating factor $(1 - p_t)^\gamma \approx 0$, making its contribution to the gradient negligible. Only misclassified or boundary examples ($p_t < 0.5$) generate significant gradients.
2. **Imbalance Compensation:** Because Abnormal ECGs outnumber Normal ones by 2.27:1, standard BCE causes the model to collapse to the majority class. Focal Loss penalizes incorrect classifications of the minority class heavily, driving the model to build a non-trivial decision boundary.

## 5. Class Imbalance in the Early 2D Image Dataset

### 5.1 The Problem

The dataset has 644 Abnormal images and 284 Normal images (ratio 2.27:1). Without correction, the optimizer minimizes overall loss, which is dominated by the majority class. The trivial solution — predict "Abnormal" for everything — achieves 69% accuracy but 0% specificity.

### 5.2 The Solution: Class-Weighted Loss

Each sample's loss contribution is scaled by its class weight:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{weighted}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{y_i} \cdot \mathcal{L}(y_i, \hat{y}_i)$$

where the inverse-frequency weights are:

$$w_c = \frac{N}{K \cdot n_c}$$

- $N$ = total training samples
- $K$ = number of classes (2)
- $n_c$ = count of class $c$

For our dataset:

$$w_{\text{Normal}} = \frac{619}{2 \times 194} = 1.60, \quad w_{\text{Abnormal}} = \frac{619}{2 \times 425} = 0.73$$

This makes each Normal sample worth 2.19× more than each Abnormal sample in the gradient computation, exactly compensating for the frequency imbalance.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Critical implementation detail:** The weights must be keyed by the generator's class index mapping, not hardcoded. Keras assigns indices alphabetically (`Abnormal=0`, `Normal=1`). Hardcoding the wrong mapping inverts the weighting — the model is penalized for correct predictions, producing AUC < 0.50 (worse than random).

> [!NOTE]
> This imbalance correction applied to the early 2D image dataset. In the final PTB-XL-only 1D model, the dataset was balanced at 1,000 Normal and 1,000 Abnormal patients. Therefore, class weights were removed and balanced focal loss used α=0.5.

## 6. BatchNorm Freezing: Why Fine-Tuning Breaks on Small Data

### 6.1 Batch Normalization Mechanics

For a mini-batch $\mathcal{B} = \{x_1, \ldots, x_m\}$, BatchNorm (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) computes:

$$\hat{x}_i = \frac{x_i - \mu_\mathcal{B}}{\sqrt{\sigma^2_\mathcal{B} + \epsilon}}$$

$$y_i = \gamma \hat{x}_i + \beta$$

where:
- $\mu_\mathcal{B} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m x_i$ is the batch mean
- $\sigma^2_\mathcal{B} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m (x_i - \mu_\mathcal{B})^2$ is the batch variance
- $\gamma, \beta$ are learned scale and shift parameters
- The layer also maintains **running statistics** $\mu_{\text{run}}, \sigma^2_{\text{run}}$ (exponential moving averages) used during inference

### 6.2 The Small-Dataset Catastrophe

When `layer.trainable = True` during fine-tuning:
1. **Batch statistics** ($\mu_\mathcal{B}, \sigma^2_\mathcal{B}$) are computed from the current mini-batch
2. **Running statistics** ($\mu_{\text{run}}, \sigma^2_{\text{run}}$) are updated toward the current batch

With batch_size=16 on ~600 images, each mini-batch is a tiny, noisy sample of the ECG distribution. The batch statistics oscillate wildly, and the running averages drift away from the stable ImageNet statistics they were pretrained on.

At test time, the model uses the corrupted $\mu_{\text{run}}, \sigma^2_{\text{run}}$ — the internal representation is standardized against the wrong distribution. Every activation is shifted and scaled incorrectly.

### 6.3 The Fix: Dual Freezing

```python
# Step 1: Prevent gradient updates to gamma/beta
layer.trainable = False

# Step 2: Force inference mode (use pretrained running stats)
x = base_model(inputs, training=False)
```

Both are required:
- `trainable=False` freezes $\gamma, \beta$ (the learned parameters)
- `training=False` forces the layer to use $\mu_{\text{run}}, \sigma^2_{\text{run}}$ from ImageNet instead of computing $\mu_\mathcal{B}, \sigma^2_\mathcal{B}$ from the current batch

## 7. Data Augmentation: Domain Constraints in Medical Imaging

### 7.1 The Augmentation Paradox in ECG

Data augmentation synthetically expands the training distribution by applying transforms $T$ to each image $x$:

$$\mathcal{D}_{\text{aug}} = \{(T(x_i), y_i) \mid (x_i, y_i) \in \mathcal{D}, T \sim \mathcal{T}\}$$

For natural images, $\mathcal{T}$ includes flips, rotations, and color distortions. For ECG images, the **geometric structure IS the diagnosis**:

### 7.2 Domain Constraint Table

| Transform | Natural Images | ECG Images | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Horizontal flip** | ✅ Safe | ❌ **Forbidden** | Reverses time axis and lead polarity |
| **Vertical flip** | ✅ Safe | ❌ **Forbidden** | Inverts waveforms = different pathology (e.g., ST elevation ↔ depression) |
| **Rotation > 2°** | ✅ Safe | ❌ **Forbidden** | Slope of ST segment IS diagnostic; rotation corrupts it |
| **Translation ±5%** | ✅ Safe | ✅ Safe | Position on the page is not diagnostic |
| **Brightness ±10%** | ✅ Safe | ✅ Safe | Scan quality variation is clinically meaningless |
| **Zoom ±5%** | ✅ Safe | ✅ Safe | Slight scale variation doesn't alter waveform morphology |

## 8. Evaluation: ROC-AUC, Confidence Intervals, and Statistical Testing

### 8.1 ROC Curve and AUC

The **Receiver Operating Characteristic** plots True Positive Rate (sensitivity) against False Positive Rate (1 - specificity) across all possible thresholds $\tau \in [0, 1]$:

$$\text{TPR}(\tau) = \frac{|\{i : \hat{y}_i \geq \tau \land y_i = 1\}|}{|\{i : y_i = 1\}|}$$

$$\text{FPR}(\tau) = \frac{|\{i : \hat{y}_i \geq \tau \land y_i = 0\}|}{|\{i : y_i = 0\}|}$$

The **Area Under the Curve** is:

$$\text{AUC} = \int_0^1 \text{TPR}(\text{FPR}^{-1}(t)) \, dt$$

**Probabilistic interpretation (Hanley & McNeil, 1982):** AUC equals the probability that a randomly chosen positive sample receives a higher score than a randomly chosen negative sample:

$$\text{AUC} = P(\hat{y}_{i^+} > \hat{y}_{j^-})$$

**Key property:** AUC is **threshold-free** and **prevalence-independent** — it measures ranking quality regardless of class imbalance. This is why it is the primary metric for this project, not accuracy.

> *Reference: Hanley, J.A. & McNeil, B.J. (1982). "The meaning and use of the area under a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve." Radiology.*

### 8.2 Youden's J Statistic (Optimal Threshold)

Youden's J selects the threshold $\tau^*$ that maximizes the sum of sensitivity and specificity:

$$\tau^* = \arg\max_\tau \left[ \text{TPR}(\tau) + \text{TNR}(\tau) - 1 \right]$$

$$= \arg\max_\tau \left[ \text{TPR}(\tau) - \text{FPR}(\tau) \right]$$

Geometrically, this is the point on the ROC curve farthest from the diagonal (random classifier line).

### 8.3 Bootstrap Confidence Intervals

With only $n = 185$ test images (48 Normal), the AUC point estimate has substantial sampling uncertainty. We quantify this via the **bootstrap** (Efron, 1979):

**Algorithm:**
1. For $b = 1, \ldots, B$ (B = 2000):
   - Draw $n$ samples with replacement from $(y_i, \hat{y}_i)_{i=1}^n$
   - Compute $\text{AUC}^{(b)}$ on the bootstrap sample
2. The 95% CI is the interval $[\text{AUC}_{(\alpha/2)}, \text{AUC}_{(1-\alpha/2)}]$ where $\alpha = 0.05$

> *Reference: Efron, B. (1979). "Bootstrap methods: another look at the jackknife." The Annals of Statistics.*

### 8.4 McNemar's Test

To test whether the model significantly differs from the trivial baseline (predict all Abnormal), we use **McNemar's test** — a paired test for two classifiers on the same test set:

Construct the 2×2 table:

|  | Baseline Correct | Baseline Wrong |
|---|---|---|
| **Model Correct** | $a$ | $b$ |
| **Model Wrong** | $c$ | $d$ |

The McNemar statistic (with continuity correction) is:

$$\chi^2 = \frac{(|b - c| - 1)^2}{b + c}$$

Under $H_0$ (equal performance), $\chi^2 \sim \chi^2_1$.

### Plain English Breakdown of the Formula:
1. **Discordant Pairs ($b$ and $c$):** The test ignores cases where both models are correct ($a$) or both are wrong ($d$). It focuses entirely on where they disagree:
   *   $b$: How many times the **Model was Correct** but the **Baseline was Wrong**.
   *   $c$: How many times the **Model was Wrong** but the **Baseline was Correct**.
2. **The Numerator $(|b - c| - 1)^2$:** 
   *   $|b - c|$ calculates the absolute difference in how often each model beats the other. If the models are equally good, we expect this difference to be close to 0.
   *   The $- 1$ is **Edwards' continuity correction**. It adjusts the discrete count values to better fit the continuous Chi-Squared distribution, preventing overestimation of statistical significance on small datasets.
   *   Squaring the result ensures the statistic is always positive and penalizes larger discrepancies.
3. **The Denominator $(b + c)$:** This is the total number of cases where the models disagreed. It acts as a scaling factor (normalization) to account for sample size.
4. **Chi-Squared Distribution ($\chi^2 \sim \chi^2_1$):** Under the Null Hypothesis ($H_0$) that both models have equal predictive accuracy, this calculated value follows a Chi-Squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom. We use this distribution to calculate the probability ($p$-value) of observing a discrepancy this large by pure chance. If the resulting $p < 0.05$, we reject $H_0$ and conclude that one model is significantly better than the other.

**Interpretation:** If $p < 0.05$, the two classifiers differ significantly. For our leakage-free model, $p = 0.88$ — the model is **not** significantly better than the trivial baseline on raw accuracy. However, it achieves 46% specificity vs. 0%, which accuracy cannot capture.

## 9. Data Leakage Detection: Perceptual Hashing

### 9.1 The Problem

The dataset lacks patient IDs. Random image-level splitting can place near-duplicate images (same patient, same recording) into different splits. The model then "generalizes" by recognizing memorized training images — artificially inflating test metrics.

### 9.2 Perceptual Hashing (pHash)

The **perceptual hash** (Zauner, 2010) maps an image to a fixed-length binary string such that visually similar images produce similar hashes:

**Algorithm:**
1. Resize image to $32 \times 32$ grayscale
2. Apply 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
3. Keep only the top-left $16 \times 16$ low-frequency coefficients
4. Compute the median $m$ of these coefficients
5. Set each bit: $h_i = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } \text{DCT}_i > m \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$

The resulting hash is a 256-bit binary string (for `hash_size=16`).

### 9.3 Near-Duplicate Clustering

Two images are **near-duplicates** if their Hamming distance is below threshold $\delta$:

$$d_H(h_a, h_b) = \sum_{i=1}^{256} \mathbb{1}[h_{a,i} \neq h_{b,i}] \leq \delta$$

We set $\delta = 6$ (out of 256 bits), which captures same-patient-different-export variations while avoiding false merges of genuinely different ECGs.

**Clustering:** Union-Find groups all transitively near-duplicate images into clusters. If any cluster spans multiple splits → **leakage detected**.

### 9.4 Impact Quantification

| Metric | Leaked Split | Clean Split | Inflation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Test AUC | 0.913 | 0.749 | +0.164 |
| Specificity | 86.4% | 45.8% | +40.6pp |
| McNemar p | 0.0014 | 0.88 | Significance vanishes |

Specificity was inflated most because the model memorized Normal images in training and recognized their near-duplicates in test.

## 10. Resolution and Information Theory

### 10.1 Why 128→224 Was the Largest Single Gain

The source ECG images are $2213 \times 1572$ pixels. Downscaling to $H \times W$ destroys spatial information. The information retained is bounded by:

$$I_{\text{retained}} \leq H \times W \times \log_2(256) \text{ bits (per channel)}$$

| Resolution | Pixels | Ratio to Source | Effect on Waveforms |
|---|---|---|---|
| 128 × 128 | 16,384 | **0.47%** of original | P-waves, ST-segment ≈ 1–2 px |
| 224 × 224 | 50,176 | **1.44%** of original | Waveform features ≈ 3–5 px |
| 384 × 384 | 147,456 | **4.24%** of original | Fine morphology visible |
| 2213 × 1572 | 3,478,836 | 100% | Full diagnostic detail |

At 128px, a 10mm P-wave on a standard ECG strip maps to approximately 1.5 pixels — below the Nyquist limit for any morphological analysis. At 224px, it maps to approximately 4 pixels, enough for the CNN to detect presence/absence and rough shape.

### 10.2 Crop-to-Aspect-Ratio

Standard resizing stretches the image, distorting the temporal axis relative to the amplitude axis. `crop_to_aspect_ratio=True` instead:

1. Scales the image so the **shorter** dimension matches the target
2. Center-crops the longer dimension to fit

This preserves the waveform's aspect ratio — a critical property since the **slope** of the ST segment is diagnostic. Stretching would corrupt all slope-based features.

## 11. Optimizer Mathematics: Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)

### 11.1 The Adam Formulation

The model optimization is executed using the **Adam** (Adaptive Moment Estimation) algorithm (Kingma & Ba, 2015), which computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter by keeping track of exponentially decaying average gradients and squared gradients.

Let $g_t$ represent the gradient of the loss function $\mathcal{L}$ with respect to the network weights $\theta$ at step $t$:

$$g_t = \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta_t)$$

The first moment vector $m_t$ (representing the mean of the gradients, or momentum) and the second raw moment vector $v_t$ (representing the uncentered variance) are updated as follows:

$$m_t = \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1) g_t$$

$$v_t = \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2) g_t^2$$

where $\beta_1, \beta_2 \in [0, 1)$ are hyperparameter values set to their standard defaults in Keras:
- $\beta_1 = 0.9$ (decay rate for momentum)
- $\beta_2 = 0.999$ (decay rate for velocity)
- $g_t^2$ represents the element-wise square $g_t \odot g_t$.

### 11.2 Bias Correction

Since $m_0$ and $v_0$ are initialized as vectors of zeros, they are biased toward zero, particularly during the initial training steps (or when the decay rates are close to 1). To counteract this bias, we calculate bias-corrected estimators:

$$\hat{m}_t = \frac{m_t}{1 - \beta_1^t}$$

$$\hat{v}_t = \frac{v_t}{1 - \beta_2^t}$$

where $\beta_1^t$ and $\beta_2^t$ denote $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ raised to the power of the step $t$.

### 11.3 Weights Update Rule

The weight updates are computed as:

$$\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{\hat{v}_t} + \epsilon} \odot \hat{m}_t$$

where:
- $\eta$ is the learning rate. In Phase 1 we set $\eta = 10^{-3}$, and in Phase 2 we set $\eta = 10^{-5}$.
- $\epsilon = 10^{-7}$ is a smoothing term used to prevent division by zero.
- $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication.

### 11.4 Rationale in Phase 1 vs. Phase 2 Fine-Tuning

1. **Phase 1 ($\eta = 10^{-3}$):** High learning rate allows the randomly initialized parameters $\theta_h$ of the classification head $g_{\theta_h}$ to adapt rapidly. The backbone $\theta_b$ is frozen (`trainable=False`), meaning no updates occur for those parameters, protecting the feature extractor from destabilization.
2. **Phase 2 ($\eta = 10^{-5}$):** Micro-learning rate prevents large updates that would destroy the fine-tuned spatial feature structures in the upper convolutional layers of $\theta_b$. The adaptive scaling of Adam ensures that layers closer to the classification head (which receive stronger gradient flows) do not update disproportionately compared to lower layers.

## 12. Regularization and Control Systems: Early Stopping and Learning Rate Decay

To prevent overfitting on the small dataset, we implement two closed-loop control callback routines: `ReduceLROnPlateau` and `EarlyStopping`, alongside a deterministic `CosineDecay` scheduler.

### 12.1 Learning Rate Annealing (ReduceLROnPlateau)

Let $\mathcal{M}_{\text{val}}(e)$ be the validation metric (validation Area Under the ROC Curve, $\text{AUC}_{\text{val}}$) computed at the end of epoch $e$. The algorithm tracks the historical maximum value achieved:

$$\mathcal{M}_{\text{val}}^{\text{best}}(e) = \max_{i \leq e} \mathcal{M}_{\text{val}}(i)$$

We define a patience counter $c_{\text{plateau}}$ that increments if the metric fails to improve by a threshold $\Delta = 10^{-4}$:

$$c_{\text{plateau}}(e) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } \mathcal{M}_{\text{val}}(e) > \mathcal{M}_{\text{val}}^{\text{best}}(e-1) + \Delta \\ c_{\text{plateau}}(e-1) + 1 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

If $c_{\text{plateau}}(e) \ge P_{\text{plateau}}$ (where patience $P_{\text{plateau}} = 4$ epochs), the learning rate is scaled by a factor $\alpha_{\text{decay}} = 0.5$:

$$\eta_{e+1} = \max(\eta_e \cdot \alpha_{\text{decay}}, \eta_{\text{min}})$$

where the minimum learning rate constraint is set to $\eta_{\text{min}} = 10^{-7}$. This mechanism allows the model to escape local minima or saddle points by taking smaller, more precise steps when convergence slows.

### 12.2 Early Termination (EarlyStopping)

Similarly, early stopping monitors validation performance to prevent the model from memorizing the training set (which manifests as a rising training loss but falling validation performance). 

Using patience $P_{\text{stop}} = 8$ epochs, we track the early stopping counter $c_{\text{stop}}$:

$$c_{\text{stop}}(e) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } \mathcal{M}_{\text{val}}(e) > \mathcal{M}_{\text{val}}^{\text{best}}(e-1) + \Delta \\ c_{\text{stop}}(e-1) + 1 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

Training is terminated at epoch $e$ if:

$$c_{\text{stop}}(e) \geq P_{\text{stop}}$$

At termination, the weights of the model are reverted to the parameters corresponding to the epoch that achieved $\mathcal{M}_{\text{val}}^{\text{best}}$, ensuring that the final output is the optimal generalizer rather than the model at the final epoch.

### 12.3 Cosine Decay Learning Rate Scheduler

For Phase 2 fine-tuning, instead of step-wise plateau decay, we implement a **Cosine Decay scheduler** (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017) to smoothly scale the learning rate down over the fine-tuning epochs.

Let $\eta_0$ be the initial learning rate, $t$ be the current global step (batch index across training), and $T$ be the total decay steps ($N_{\text{epochs}} \times N_{\text{steps\_per\_epoch}}$). The learning rate at step $t$ is calculated as:

$$\eta_t = \eta_{\text{min}} + \frac{1}{2}(\eta_0 - \eta_{\text{min}}) \left( 1 + \cos\left( \frac{\pi t}{T} \right) \right)$$

In this project:
*   $\eta_0 = 1 \times 10^{-5}$
*   $\eta_{\text{min}} = 1 \times 10^{-7}$ (or $\alpha = 0.01$ of $\eta_0$)
*   $T = 30 \text{ epochs} \times 39 \text{ steps/epoch} = 1170 \text{ steps}$

**Why it helps:**
1. **Smooth Parameter Adaptations:** Sudden learning rate drops (like in Step Decay) can cause the weights to jump erratically in a small medical dataset. A smooth cosine curve allows the Adam optimizer to continuously adjust its parameters without destroying pretrained feature representations.
2. **Fine-Tuning Stability:** The slow decay rate towards the end of training forces the gradients to decrease, preventing the model from oscillating around the local optimum and allowing it to settle into a wider, more stable basin.

## 13. Pooling Layer Mechanics: Global Average Pooling vs. Flattening

### 13.1 Spatial Dimensions Collapse

The feature maps generated by the final convolutional layer of EfficientNetB0 have a shape of $H \times W \times C$ (where $H = 7$, $W = 7$, and $C = 1280$ for an input of $224 \times 224$). 

Let $A_{i,j,c}$ represent the activation of the network at spatial location $(i,j)$ for channel $c$. We compare two operations to prepare this tensor for the classification layer:

1. **Flattening:**
   $$\text{Flatten}(A) = \vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{flatten}}}, \quad d_{\text{flatten}} = H \cdot W \cdot C = 7 \cdot 7 \cdot 1280 = 62,720$$
   This representation is then fed into a dense classification layer with weights $W_c \in \mathbb{R}^{62720 \times 1}$, adding **62,720 trainable parameters**.

2. **Global Average Pooling (GAP):**
   $$\text{GAP}(A) = \vec{u} \in \mathbb{R}^{C}, \quad u_c = \frac{1}{H \cdot W} \sum_{i=1}^H \sum_{j=1}^W A_{i,j,c}$$
   This collapses the spatial dimensions by averaging, leaving only the channel dimension $C = 1280$. The dense classification layer weights $W_c \in \mathbb{R}^{1280 \times 1}$ add only **1,280 trainable parameters**.

### 13.2 Rationale

- **Regularization:** By reducing the parameters in the classification layer from 62,720 to 1,280, GAP prevents overfitting on small datasets.
- **Translation Invariance:** GAP enforces that the presence of a feature is captured regardless of where it appears spatially in the final feature maps. For ECG plots, where lead structures appear in different grids but share morphological properties (e.g. ST elevations), this spatial averaging acts as a strong inductive bias.
- **Direct Correspondence:** GAP makes the feature map channel directly corresponding to the category confidence, which simplifies the application of interpretability techniques (such as Class Activation Mapping).

## 14. Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) as Monte Carlo Integration

### 14.1 Mathematical Rationale

Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) can be formalised as a Monte Carlo approximation to marginalize prediction predictions over a distribution of nuisance spatial and photometric transformations.

Let $x$ be a test ECG image, and let $\mathcal{T}$ represent a distribution over domain-safe transformations (e.g., small shifts, brightness changes) that do not alter the ground truth label $y$. We wish to estimate the expectation of the model's prediction under this distribution:

$$\mathbb{E}_{T \sim \mathcal{T}} [f_\theta(T(x))]$$

By sampling $K$ independent transformations $T_1, T_2, \dots, T_K$ from $\mathcal{T}$ (where $T_1$ is the identity transform), we obtain the Monte Carlo estimator:

$$\hat{y}_{\text{TTA}} = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K f_\theta(T_k(x))$$

### 14.2 Error Reduction

By averaging over these transformed variants, TTA reduces the prediction variance caused by high-frequency spatial noise or digitization artifacts (such as scanner contrast changes). Because the model is non-linear, this integration pushes predictions closer to the decision boundary or consolidates predictions that are highly confident under minor modifications, improving the stability of the classification scores.

## 15. Methodological Resolution: Overcoming the Source Confound

### 15.1 The McNemar Test Reveal on 2D Images
Despite implementing state-of-the-art architectures, rigorous regularization, leakage prevention (pHash), and spatial skeletonization, the 2D image models retained an incredibly high AUC (0.9718). However, when properly subjected to **McNemar's Test** against a trivial baseline (predicting the majority class), the $p$-value was **0.5596**. 

This statistical finding proved that the model was no better than blind guessing on accuracy terms. The AUC entirely captured the model's ability to separate the dataset's **Source Confound** (Latidos = Normal, PTB-XL = Abnormal) rather than actual cardiovascular physiology. The 2D representations inherently embed origin markers (like rendering algorithms and grid artifacts) that deep CNNs effortlessly exploit as shortcuts.

### 15.2 Redesigning the Dataset to Break the Source-Label Link
The source-label confound cannot be fixed by preprocessing alone. Redesigning the dataset to break the link between source and label requires evaluating four potential methodological fixes:
1. **Fix Option 1 — Use PTB-XL Only (Chosen Solution):** By using only PTB-XL raw 1D signals (where Normal = NORM superclass and Abnormal = non-NORM superclasses), the source is kept constant (both Normal and Abnormal come from PTB-XL). The model cannot cheat by learning Latidos vs PTB-XL differences, and StratifiedGroupKFold on patient_id prevents patient-level leakage. This is the cleanest and most defensible methodology available within the project constraints.
2. **Fix Option 2 — Make the Image Dataset Source-Balanced:** This requires compiling Normal and Abnormal cases from both sources (e.g., 100 Normal and 100 Abnormal from Latidos, and 100 Normal and 100 Abnormal from PTB-XL), splitting with StratifiedGroupKFold grouped by patient and stratified by `labels + "_" + source_ids`. However, because the available Latidos dataset did not contain Abnormal cases, this option was impossible to implement.
3. **Fix Option 3 — Test Source Generalization:** Train the model on one source (e.g., PTB-XL Normal vs Abnormal) and test it on another independent source. If diagnostic performance generalizes, it suggests physiological learning. While a strong audit tool, it is not a direct fix for the original combined dataset.
4. **Fix Option 4 — Remove Image Artifacts (Visual Preprocessing):** Standardizing dimensions, binarizing, skeletonizing, and edge-cropping header text reduces visual shortcuts, but it cannot break the underlying confound. The source remains encoded in residual geometry (waveform layouts, lead ordering, spacing, sampling artifacts, grid rendering styles).

**Methodological Conclusion:** Redesigning the dataset so that source and label are not perfectly aligned is the only valid correction. Since the available image dataset did not contain both labels in both sources, the project adopted Fix Option 1: a PTB-XL-only 1D ECG pipeline with patient-disjoint cross-validation.

### 15.3 The 1D Physiological Pipeline (The Solution)
The mathematical and structural solution to this confound was to pivot to the raw time-series domain. By exclusively utilizing the **PhysioNet PTB-XL database** (a single clinical source), the origin confound was eliminated by definition. We constructed a 1D Convolutional Neural Network processing the raw 10-second, 12-lead voltage matrices.

#### A. Patient-level Leakage Control
A critical methodological vulnerability in clinical datasets is **patient leakage**. PTB-XL contains multiple ECG records for certain patients. If a dataset is split randomly by record, a patient's baseline ECG could land in the training set while their follow-up ECG lands in the test set. The model could then achieve artificially high accuracy by memorizing patient-specific morphology (like unique QRS shapes or baseline wander signatures) rather than learning generalized disease patterns.

To mathematically guarantee zero leakage in the 1D pipeline, the dataset was subjected to patient-level leakage control:
1. All records were loaded with their corresponding `patient_id` metadata.
2. One ECG record per patient was retained before sampling, so no patient could appear in more than one fold.
3. The final dataset of 2,000 records (1,000 Normal, 1,000 Abnormal) consists of exactly 2,000 unique patients. 
For larger-scale training using all available records, `StratifiedGroupKFold` by `patient_id` would be required. Because only one record per patient was retained in this MVP, `StratifiedKFold` also preserves patient-disjoint evaluation.

#### B. Preprocessing
Signals are extracted at 100Hz, bandpass-filtered from 0.5–40 Hz to reduce baseline wander and high-frequency/line-noise contamination, and standard-scaled ($Z$-normalization) per lead.

#### C. Architecture
A deep 1D-CNN (Conv1D $\rightarrow$ BatchNorm $\rightarrow$ MaxPooling1D $\rightarrow$ GlobalAveragePooling1D) replaces spatial 2D kernels with temporal 1D kernels. Instead of looking for visual rendering patterns, it slides across the time axis to detect QRS complexes, ST segments, and T-waves mathematically.

#### D. 5-Fold Stratified Cross Validation
To capture the variance inherent in evaluating on a small subset (40 records per fold), the 1D pipeline was evaluated using a strict 5-Fold Stratified Cross Validation. 

### 15.4 1D Results & Operating Point Analysis

The first PTB-XL-only 1D pilot demonstrated that raw ECG signals contained learnable physiological signal once the Latidos-vs-PTB-XL image-source confound was removed. In the early 200-patient pilot, the 1D model achieved approximately ROC-AUC 0.8540 ± 0.0637, sensitivity 0.8000 ± 0.1049, and specificity 0.7500 ± 0.0949 under validation-only threshold calibration.

The final 1D pipeline substantially improved this result by scaling the dataset to 2,000 unique patients, using a balanced 1,000 Normal / 1,000 Abnormal design, removing redundant class weights, applying balanced focal loss with α=0.5, using a tightly regularized 2-block 1D ResNet, fitting Platt scaling strictly on nested validation slices, selecting thresholds without test leakage, and reporting performance through out-of-fold aggregation.

The final internally validated PTB-XL result was:

| Metric | Final 1D ResNet OOF Result |
|---|---|
| ROC-AUC | 0.9243 |
| PR-AUC | 0.9241 |
| Accuracy | 0.8440 |
| Sensitivity | 0.8480 |
| Specificity | 0.8400 |

This result should be interpreted as strong internal PTB-XL validation, not external clinical validation. The model is ready for external validation on independent ECG datasets and for subgroup analysis across MI, STTC, CD, and HYP.

### 15.5 Future Work & Sensitivity Improvement Plan
To transition this proof-of-feasibility toward a clinically credible diagnostic model, future development should prioritize:
1. **Dataset Expansion:** Scale the 1D pipeline beyond the 200-record pilot and use the full PTB-XL dataset where possible.
2. **Patient-Grouped Splitting:** Use StratifiedGroupKFold grouped by `patient_id` to prevent patient-level leakage when multiple records per patient are retained.
3. **Frozen Threshold Validation:** Select the operating threshold on validation data only, then evaluate it once on an untouched patient-disjoint test set.
4. **Probability Calibration:** Apply Platt scaling or isotonic regression on validation data to improve probability reliability before threshold selection.
5. **Loss Function Adjustment:** Retrain with abnormal-class weighting or focal loss so that false negatives are penalized more strongly.
6. **Subtype Balancing:** Balance the Abnormal superclass across MI, STTC, CD, and HYP to avoid dominance by one abnormal subtype.
7. **PR-AUC Reporting:** Report PR-AUC because Abnormal is the clinically important positive class.
8. **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals:** Report confidence intervals for ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, sensitivity, specificity, F1, and accuracy.
9. **External Validation:** Test the model on an independent ECG dataset to check whether performance generalizes beyond PTB-XL.

### 15.6 Limitations
The 1D pipeline resolves the specific Latidos-vs-PTB-XL visual source confound found in the two-source image dataset by using PTB-XL-only raw ECG signals. Scaling the dataset from 200 to 2,000 unique patients, combined with nested calibration and OOF aggregation, substantially reduced the instability seen in the pilot experiments and produced stable internal validation estimates. However, full clinical readiness still requires external validation on independent ECG cohorts. In addition, PTB-XL diagnostic superclasses define a broad Normal-versus-Abnormal screening task rather than a specific clinical diagnosis. Therefore, the 1D model should be interpreted as a strong internally validated screening model and proof of feasibility, not as a clinically validated diagnostic system.

### 15.7 Conclusion
The original 2D image-based ECG classifier achieved high apparent AUC values, but the methodological audit showed that these results were driven by leakage, visual shortcuts, and ultimately a source-label confound: Normal images came from Latidos, while Abnormal images came from PTB-XL. Because source and label were aligned, the 2D CNN could not be interpreted as learning diagnostic ECG physiology.
The project therefore transitioned to a PTB-XL-only raw 1D ECG pipeline with patient-level leakage control, balanced diagnostic superclass sampling, nested calibration, nested threshold selection, and OOF aggregation. This removed the specific Latidos-vs-PTB-XL confound and produced strong internal validation performance on 2,000 unique patients: ROC-AUC 0.9243, PR-AUC 0.9241, sensitivity 0.8480, and specificity 0.8400.
The final defensible claim is that the 1D raw-signal pipeline is a strong internally validated ECG screening model, ready for external validation, but not yet clinically deployed or externally validated. The main lesson of the project is methodological: high AUC is only meaningful after leakage, source confounding, patient overlap, threshold selection, and calibration bias have been systematically audited.

## 16. Multimodal Fusion: The Heartbreaker Architecture

To push beyond the purely physiological upper bound of the 1D ResNet, the project implements a second-stage multimodal classifier: **Heartbreaker**. This architecture formalises the fusion of physiological representation learning with tabular clinical context and natural language diagnostics.

### 16.1 Late Fusion Strategy
Heartbreaker employs a **late fusion (feature-level fusion)** paradigm. In late fusion, independent modalities are processed by domain-specific encoders before their abstract representations are joined. 

For a physiological input $x_{\text{physio}}$ and a metadata input $x_{\text{meta}}$, the fused prediction is:

$$\hat{y} = f_{\text{fusion}} \left( \phi_{\text{frozen}}(x_{\text{physio}}), \psi_{\text{tabular}}(x_{\text{meta}}) \right)$$

where:
- $\phi_{\text{frozen}}$ is the 1D ResNet encoder, truncated at the `GlobalAveragePooling1D` layer. This yields a $128$-dimensional physiological embedding $E_{\text{ecg}} \in \mathbb{R}^{128}$.
- $\psi_{\text{tabular}}$ is a dense metadata encoder that processes continuous, binary, and TF-IDF features into a contextual embedding $E_{\text{meta}} \in \mathbb{R}^{32}$.
- $f_{\text{fusion}}$ is the final classification head (either a Logistic Regression model on probabilities or a Multi-Layer Perceptron on embeddings).

```mermaid

    Tab_Embed --> Concat
    
    Concat --> FusionMLP["Fusion MLP Head<br/>(🔓 Trainable)"]
    FusionMLP --> Output["Sigmoid Output<br/>P(Abnormal)"]
```

**Why Frozen Encoder?** The 1D ResNet weights $\theta_{\text{resnet}}$ are strictly frozen during multimodal training. Because the available dataset is constrained ($N=2000$), joint training (unfreezing the ResNet alongside the fusion head) would cause catastrophic overfitting, allowing the vast capacity of the CNN to memorize the training split.

### 16.2 Leakage Controls in Natural Language Processing (TF-IDF)
The clinical metadata includes German cardiologist reports. Because these reports are generated *after* the ECG interpretation, they often contain the ground-truth diagnosis in text form (e.g., "myokardinfarkt"). Using raw TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectors would result in trivial, 100% predictive leakage.

To mathematically sterilize the text features, Heartbreaker implements a strict **intra-fold correlation audit**:
1. Within a specific cross-validation fold, the TF-IDF matrix $X_{\text{tfidf}}$ is computed strictly on the training partition.
2. The Point-Biserial Correlation Coefficient $r_{pb}$ is calculated between every term frequency vector $x_j$ and the binary ground truth $y$:
   $$r_{pb} = \frac{M_1 - M_0}{s_n} \sqrt{\frac{n_1 n_0}{n^2}}$$
3. Any term $j$ where $|r_{pb}| \ge 0.25$ is unconditionally dropped from the vocabulary.
4. The sterilized TF-IDF fitted transformer is then applied to the validation partition.

This ensures the model can utilize sub-diagnostic physiological language (e.g., "sinusrhythmus") without cheating by reading the final diagnostic ruling.

> [!WARNING]
> Correlation filtering reduces obvious text-label leakage but does not guarantee complete removal of diagnostic information. Clinical reports may encode diagnosis through many weakly correlated terms or phrase combinations. Therefore, report-text fusion should be treated as exploratory unless validated with stricter controls, including manual diagnostic-term blacklists, structured-metadata-only comparison, and external validation.

### 16.3 Tier 1 vs. Tier 2 Fusion

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The primary leakage-safe Heartbreaker experiment uses structured demographics only (`age`, `sex`, `BMI`), excluding both workflow flags and report-derived axis flags. Incorporating the transcribed `heart_axis` or raw report-text TF-IDF should be evaluated strictly as secondary/exploratory analyses due to feature-provenance leakage risks.

**Tier 1: Probability Fusion (Ensemble)**  
Instead of fusing feature vectors, Tier 1 fuses the scalar outputs of the independent models using Logistic Regression:
$$P(\text{Abnormal} \mid x) = \sigma(w_1 P_{\text{ecg}} + w_2^T X_{\text{meta}} + b)$$
This provides a highly interpretable, convex baseline. Fusing demographics with the ECG signal via Tier 1 achieves a robust OOF ROC-AUC of **0.9771 [95% CI: 0.9698–0.9832]**, sensitivity **0.8520 [95% CI: 0.8302–0.8732]**, and specificity **0.9630 [95% CI: 0.9502–0.9749]**, satisfying the clinical sensitivity constraint ($\ge 0.85$).

**Tier 2: Embedding Fusion (MLP)**  
Tier 2 concatenates the $128$-dim physiological embedding with a $32$-dim metadata embedding, passing the joined vector through a fusion MLP:
$$E_{\text{fused}} = \left[ E_{\text{ecg}} \parallel \text{ReLU}(W_{\text{meta}} X_{\text{meta}} + b_{\text{meta}}) \right]$$
$$P(\text{Abnormal} \mid x) = \sigma(W_{\text{fusion}} \cdot \text{Dropout}(E_{\text{fused}}) + b_{\text{fusion}})$$
This model allows non-linear interactions between ECG morphology features and demographics. In the primary demographics-only configuration, Tier 2 achieves an OOF ROC-AUC of **0.9753 [95% CI: 0.9680–0.9819]**, sensitivity **0.8510 [95% CI: 0.8295–0.8718]**, and specificity **0.9670 [95% CI: 0.9547–0.9782]**, also satisfying the sensitivity constraint.

Fusing demographics + `heart_axis` (secondary model) via Tier 1 achieves an OOF ROC-AUC of **0.9782 [95% CI: 0.9710–0.9843]** and specificity **0.9670**. Out-of-fold stress testing with joint-block permutation shuffling shows that shuffling the `workflow_flags` group results in an AUC of **0.8656** (only a **-0.0064** drop), proving the model is not relying on acquisition shortcuts. Shuffling demographics jointly yields a drop of **-0.0611**, and shuffling `heart_axis` yields a drop of **-0.0360**.

Heartbreaker ultimately proves that physiological time-series and clinical context are strongly complementary, provided that multimodal fusion is subjected to identical, rigorous patient-disjoint nested calibration constraints as the unimodal baseline.

### 16.4 Interpretation of Heartbreaker
Heartbreaker should be interpreted as a second-stage multimodal extension of the validated 1D ECG model. The ECG-only ResNet remains the physiological backbone. Its final sigmoid head, threshold, and Platt scaler are not reused directly; instead, the penultimate ECG embedding is fused with structured metadata and a new fusion classifier is trained, calibrated, and validated separately.
The main scientific question is not whether metadata can inflate AUC, but whether multimodal fusion improves clinical utility without sacrificing the screening sensitivity objective and without introducing leakage. Therefore, Heartbreaker should be accepted only if it remains leakage-safe, preserves sensitivity near or above 0.85, improves at least one clinically relevant metric, and generalizes under external validation.

## 17. Multi-Heartbreaker: Multi-Label 5-Class Diagnostic Classification

### 17.1 Motivation — From Binary Screening to Differential Diagnosis

The binary models (1D ResNet and Heartbreaker) answer a single question: *"Is this ECG normal or abnormal?"* While this is clinically useful as a triage tool, real cardiological practice requires the next step: *"If abnormal, what kind of abnormality?"*

The **Multi-Heartbreaker** pipeline extends the project from a binary screener into a multi-label diagnostic classifier that identifies **5 co-occurring pathology superclasses** from a single 12-lead ECG recording. This is clinically significant because patients frequently present with multiple simultaneous conditions (e.g., a patient with both Myocardial Infarction and ST/T-Changes).

### 17.2 The 5 Diagnostic Superclasses

The PTB-XL database annotates each recording with one or more SCP (Standard Communications Protocol) diagnostic codes. These 71 fine-grained codes are grouped into 5 clinically meaningful superclasses defined by the dataset authors (Wagner et al., 2020):

| Superclass | Abbreviation | Clinical Definition | Example SCP Codes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Normal ECG** | NORM | A healthy baseline electrocardiogram showing regular sinus rhythm without structurally significant abnormalities. | NORM, SR |
| **Myocardial Infarction** | MI | Localized death of heart muscle tissue caused by a sudden blockage in coronary blood supply, often referred to as a "heart attack." Identified by pathological Q waves, ST elevation, and T-wave inversions in specific lead groups. | IMI, AMI, ALMI, ASMI, ILMI, IPLMI, IPMI, PMI, LMI |
| **ST/T-Change** | STTC | Abnormalities in the ST segment or T wave that often indicate early-stage ischemia (reduced blood flow to the heart muscle) or repolarization abnormalities. These changes are among the earliest ECG signs of cardiac distress. | ISC_, ISCA, ISCAL, ISCI, ISCIL, ISCLA, NDT, NST_, STD_, STE_, TAB_, NT_ |
| **Conduction Disturbance** | CD | Interruptions or delays in the electrical pathways of the heart. These include bundle branch blocks (where electrical signals are delayed through the left or right bundle branches), AV blocks, and fascicular blocks. | CLBBB, CRBBB, IRBBB, ILBBB, LAFB, LPFB, WPW, IVCD, 1AVB, 2AVB, 3AVB |
| **Hypertrophy** | HYP | Abnormal thickening of the heart muscle wall, typically caused by chronic high blood pressure or valve disease. Diagnosed by voltage criteria (e.g., Sokolow-Lyon index) and strain patterns. | LVH, RVH, LAO/LAE, RAO/RAE, SEHYP |

### 17.3 Multi-Label vs. Multi-Class Formulation

A critical design decision is the choice between **multi-class** (mutually exclusive) and **multi-label** (co-occurring) formulation.

**Multi-class (Softmax)** assumes each sample belongs to exactly one class:
$$P(y = c \mid x) = \frac{e^{z_c}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}}, \quad \sum_{c=1}^{K} P(y = c \mid x) = 1$$

**Multi-label (Sigmoid)** treats each class as an independent binary classification:
$$P(y_c = 1 \mid x) = \sigma(z_c) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z_c}}, \quad c \in \{1, \ldots, K\}$$

We chose **multi-label** because:
1. **Clinical reality:** A patient can have both MI and STTC simultaneously (ST changes are a hallmark of acute MI).
2. **Independence:** Each sigmoid output is independent, so assigning label $c_1$ does not affect the probability of label $c_2$.
3. **Loss function:** Binary cross-entropy is applied independently per class, averaged across all $K=5$ outputs:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{multi-label}} = -\frac{1}{K} \sum_{c=1}^{K} \left[ y_c \log(\hat{y}_c) + (1 - y_c) \log(1 - \hat{y}_c) \right]$$

### 17.4 Data Management — Scaling the Dataset

#### A. Initial MVP (2,000 Records)
The first iteration used a stratified sampling strategy selecting up to 1,000 records per superclass (with overlap allowed for multi-label samples), yielding 2,000 unique patients.

#### B. Scaled Dataset (3,883 Records)
To improve rare-class performance, the dataset generator was modified to use **all** records with valid superclass labels AND signal files available on disk. This removed the artificial per-class cap and nearly doubled the dataset:

| Superclass | MVP (2,000 records) | Scaled (3,883 records) | Increase |
|---|---|---|---|
| NORM | 1,000 | 2,194 | +119% |
| MI | 242 | 436 | +80% |
| STTC | 362 | 688 | +90% |
| CD | 362 | 705 | +95% |
| HYP | 121 | 240 | +98% |

Patient-level deduplication was maintained: `df.drop_duplicates(subset=['patient_id'])` ensures that no patient contributes more than one record. The leakage audit confirmed 3,883 unique patients with zero overlap.

#### C. SCP Code Confidence Threshold
Only SCP codes with confidence > 50% are mapped to superclasses:
```python
for code, conf in scp_codes_dict.items():
    if code in scp_to_class:
        if conf > 50:  # Only confident diagnoses
            classes.add(scp_to_class[code])
```
This prevents ambiguous or uncertain annotations from contaminating the labels.

### 17.5 CNN Architecture — Multi-Label 1D ResNet

The Multi-Heartbreaker CNN reuses the identical 2-block 1D ResNet architecture from the binary pipeline, with a single structural modification at the output layer:

| Component | Binary Model | Multi-Heartbreaker |
|---|---|---|
| Input | `(1000, 12)` — 10s @ 100Hz, 12 leads | Same |
| Stem Conv | `Conv1D(32, k=15)` + BN + ReLU | Same |
| Block 1 | `Conv1D(64, k=11)` × 2 + residual + MaxPool | Same |
| Block 2 | `Conv1D(128, k=7)` × 2 + residual + GAP | Same |
| Dense Head | `Dense(64, relu)` + Dropout(0.5) | Same |
| **Output** | **`Dense(1, sigmoid)`** | **`Dense(5, sigmoid)`** |
| **Loss** | **Binary focal loss** | **Binary cross-entropy** |
| **Metric** | **AUC (single)** | **AUC (multi-label, 5 classes)** |

```mermaid

```

The residual connections within each block follow the standard ResNet identity mapping:
$$\mathbf{x}_{l+1} = \text{ReLU}(\mathbf{x}_l + \mathcal{F}(\mathbf{x}_l, W_l))$$

where $\mathcal{F}$ is the convolutional block (Conv1D → BN → ReLU → Dropout → Conv1D → BN) and the shortcut uses a 1×1 convolution to match channel dimensions.

L2 weight regularization ($\lambda = 10^{-4}$) is applied to all convolutional and dense kernels to prevent overfitting.

### 17.6 Training Protocol

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| K-Fold splits | 5 | Standard for clinical validation; 80/20 train/test ratio per fold |
| Epochs per fold | 40 | Sufficient for gradient convergence on 3,883 records |
| Batch size | 32 | Balance between gradient noise and Metal GPU memory |
| Early stopping | `patience=15`, `monitor=val_auc`, `mode=max` | Prevents overfitting; restores best weights |
| Optimizer | Adam ($\eta = 10^{-3}$, $\beta_1=0.9$, $\beta_2=0.999$) | Standard adaptive optimizer |
| Data augmentation | Gaussian noise ($\sigma=0.02$), amplitude scaling (0.85–1.15×), temporal shift (±40 samples) | Applied with 50% probability per sample |

### 17.7 Out-of-Fold (OOF) Evaluation

The OOF procedure guarantees that every prediction was made by a model that **never saw** the corresponding patient during training:

1. For each fold $k \in \{1, \ldots, 5\}$:
   - Train on folds $\{1, \ldots, 5\} \setminus \{k\}$
   - Predict on fold $k$ → store predictions at indices corresponding to fold $k$
2. After all 5 folds, the OOF prediction vector covers the **entire** dataset
3. Compute metrics against the full ground truth

This is mathematically equivalent to a held-out test set for the purpose of metric computation, but uses all available data.

## 18. Clinical Feature Engineering for LightGBM

### 18.1 The Insight — Encoding Cardiology into Features

The CNN learns features from raw waveforms through gradient descent. For rare classes like HYP (240 samples), 40 epochs may be insufficient to discover the same diagnostic patterns that cardiologists have codified over decades.

The key insight is that the **definitions of each pathology** can be directly computed from the signal:

- A cardiologist diagnoses **Hypertrophy** by computing the **Sokolow-Lyon index**: $S_{V1} + R_{V5/V6} > 3.5 \text{ mV}$
- A cardiologist diagnoses **Myocardial Infarction** by finding **pathological Q waves** and **ST elevation** in specific lead groups
- A cardiologist diagnoses **Conduction Disturbance** by measuring **QRS duration** > 120 ms
- A cardiologist diagnoses **ST/T-Changes** by identifying **T-wave inversions** and **ST segment deviations**

By computing these features explicitly and training a gradient-boosted tree model (LightGBM), we bypass the sample-size limitation of the CNN. The model doesn't need to *learn* that Sokolow-Lyon > 3.5 mV means hypertrophy — it receives Sokolow-Lyon directly as an input feature.

### 18.2 Feature Extraction Pipeline

From each 12-lead ECG (1000 samples × 12 leads @ 100 Hz), we extract **59 clinical features** organized into 6 groups:

#### A. General Rhythm Features
| Feature | Description | Clinical Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| `heart_rate` | Mean HR from R-R intervals (BPM) | Tachycardia/bradycardia detection |
| `n_beats` | Number of detected R-peaks | Signal quality indicator |
| `rr_mean`, `rr_std`, `rr_range` | R-R interval statistics (seconds) | Arrhythmia and HRV assessment |
| `qrs_duration_ms` | Median QRS complex width (ms) | CD: >120ms suggests bundle branch block |
| `qtc_bazett` | Corrected QT interval (Bazett's formula: $QT_c = \frac{QT}{\sqrt{RR}}$) | Long QT syndrome screening |

#### B. Hypertrophy Features (HYP)
| Feature | Formula | Clinical Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| `sokolow_lyon` | $\|S_{V1}\| + \max(R_{V5}, R_{V6})$ | > 3.5 mV suggests LVH |
| `cornell_voltage` | $R_{aVL} + \|S_{V3}\|$ | > 2.8 mV (men) / 2.0 mV (women) suggests LVH |

#### C. Myocardial Infarction Features (MI)
| Feature Group | Leads | What It Captures |
|---|---|---|
| `q_depth_anterior`, `q_duration_anterior` | V1, V2, V3, V4 | Anterior wall MI (LAD territory) |
| `q_depth_inferior`, `q_duration_inferior` | II, III, aVF | Inferior wall MI (RCA territory) |
| `q_depth_lateral`, `q_duration_lateral` | I, aVL, V5, V6 | Lateral wall MI (LCx territory) |
| `st_deviation_anterior`, `st_max_abs_anterior` | V1–V4 | Acute anterior STEMI |
| `st_deviation_inferior`, `st_max_abs_inferior` | II, III, aVF | Acute inferior STEMI |
| `st_deviation_lateral`, `st_max_abs_lateral` | I, aVL, V5, V6 | Acute lateral STEMI |

#### D. ST/T-Change Features (STTC)
| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| `t_inversion_count` | Number of leads showing T-wave inversion (across all 12 leads) |
| `t_amp_mean`, `t_amp_std` | T-wave amplitude statistics (negative = inverted) |
| `st_deviation_global_mean`, `st_deviation_global_std`, `st_deviation_global_max` | Global ST segment deviation across all leads |

#### E. Conduction Disturbance Features (CD)
| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| `qrs_duration_ms` | >120ms = bundle branch block |
| `rs_ratio_V1` through `rs_ratio_V6` | R/S amplitude ratio per precordial lead — abnormal progression suggests LBBB/RBBB |
| `rs_transition_zone` | V-lead where R/S ratio first exceeds 1.0 — normally V3/V4 |

#### F. Signal Quality Features
| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| `signal_rms_I` through `signal_rms_V6` | Root Mean Square amplitude per lead |
| `total_signal_energy` | Total squared amplitude across all leads |

#### G. R-Peak Detection Algorithm
R-peaks are detected using `scipy.signal.find_peaks` with:
- Minimum inter-peak distance: 300ms (maximum physiological heart rate ~200 BPM)
- Adaptive height threshold: 40% of maximum absolute amplitude in Lead II
- Post-filtering: R-R intervals outside the 0.3–2.0 second physiological range are rejected

### 18.3 LightGBM One-vs-Rest Multi-Label Classifier

#### A. Algorithm Choice
LightGBM (Ke et al., 2017) is a gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) framework that uses histogram-based splitting and leaf-wise tree growth for high speed and accuracy on tabular data.

For multi-label classification, we train **5 independent binary LightGBM classifiers** (one per superclass). This one-vs-rest (OVR) strategy:
- Treats each class independently, matching the sigmoid multi-label formulation
- Allows per-class hyperparameter tuning (e.g., different `scale_pos_weight` values)
- Enables per-class interpretability through feature importance analysis

> *Reference: Ke, G., Meng, Q., Finley, T., Wang, T., Chen, W., Ma, W., Ye, Q., & Liu, T.-Y. (2017). "LightGBM: A Highly Efficient Gradient Boosting Decision Tree." NeurIPS.*

#### B. Class Imbalance Handling
Each binary classifier uses `scale_pos_weight` to compensate for class prevalence:

$$\text{scale\_pos\_weight}_c = \frac{N - n_c}{n_c}$$

where $N$ is the total number of training samples and $n_c$ is the number of positive samples for class $c$. This scales the loss contribution of positive samples to balance the gradient signal.

#### C. Training Configuration
| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `boosting_type` | `gbdt` | Standard gradient boosted trees |
| `num_leaves` | 31 | Default; prevents overfitting on <4K samples |
| `learning_rate` | 0.05 | Conservative for stable convergence |
| `feature_fraction` | 0.8 | Column subsampling for regularization |
| `bagging_fraction` | 0.8 | Row subsampling for variance reduction |
| `num_boost_round` | 500 (max) | With early stopping at 50 rounds patience |
| `metric` | AUC | Directly optimizes ranking quality |

#### D. Feature Importance — What the Model Learned
The LightGBM feature importances (averaged gain across 5 folds) confirm that the model learned the correct clinical features for each pathology:

| Class | Top 3 Features | Clinical Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| **HYP** | `total_signal_energy`, **`sokolow_lyon`**, `st_deviation_lateral` | ✅ Sokolow-Lyon is the textbook HYP criterion |
| **MI** | `t_amp_mean`, `signal_rms_aVR`, **`q_depth_inferior`** | ✅ Q-wave depth is the textbook old MI marker |
| **STTC** | `t_amp_mean`, **`st_deviation_lateral`**, `t_inversion_count` | ✅ ST/T morphology is the definition of STTC |
| **CD** | `signal_rms_III`, **`rs_ratio_V6`**, `q_duration_lateral` | ✅ R/S progression encodes bundle branch blocks |
| **NORM** | `t_amp_mean`, `t_inversion_count`, `q_duration_lateral` | ✅ Absence of pathological markers → normal |

This is powerful evidence that the model is learning genuine cardiological signals rather than statistical artifacts.

## 19. Per-Class Optimal Thresholds and Operating Points

### 19.1 Why a Single Threshold Fails for Multi-Label

In binary classification, we select one threshold $\tau^*$ (via Youden's J) and apply it to the single sigmoid output. In multi-label classification with 5 classes of wildly different prevalence, a single threshold is mathematically suboptimal:

- **NORM** has prevalence 56.5% (2,194/3,883) — threshold should be relatively high
- **HYP** has prevalence 6.2% (240/3,883) — threshold must be much lower to avoid missing all positives

Each class $c$ needs its own threshold $\tau_c^*$ computed independently on its own ROC curve:

$$\tau_c^* = \arg\max_\tau \left[ \text{TPR}_c(\tau) - \text{FPR}_c(\tau) \right]$$

### 19.2 Operating Point Table

At each per-class optimal threshold, we report:
- **Sensitivity** (True Positive Rate): $\frac{TP}{TP + FN}$ — "Of all patients with this condition, what fraction did the model catch?"
- **Specificity** (True Negative Rate): $\frac{TN}{TN + FP}$ — "Of all patients without this condition, what fraction did the model correctly rule out?"
- **PPV** (Positive Predictive Value): $\frac{TP}{TP + FP}$ — "Of all patients the model flagged, what fraction actually had the condition?"
- **NPV** (Negative Predictive Value): $\frac{TN}{TN + FN}$ — "Of all patients the model cleared, what fraction were truly healthy?"
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of Precision (PPV) and Recall (Sensitivity): $F_1 = \frac{2 \cdot PPV \cdot Sens}{PPV + Sens}$

### 19.3 Bootstrap Confidence Intervals

To quantify statistical uncertainty, we compute 95% bootstrap CIs for each per-class ROC-AUC:

**Algorithm:**
1. For $b = 1, \ldots, B$ ($B = 1000$):
   - Draw $n$ samples with replacement from $(y_{c,i}, \hat{y}_{c,i})_{i=1}^n$
   - Compute $\text{AUC}_c^{(b)}$ on the bootstrap sample
2. The 95% CI is $[\text{AUC}_{c,(2.5\%)}, \text{AUC}_{c,(97.5\%)}]$

This matches the rigor applied to the binary model's validation report.

## 21. Subgroup and Demographic Fairness Analysis

ECG classification models risk learning demographic shortcuts or showing disparate performance across subgroups due to physiological or waveform presentation differences (e.g., changes in ventricular mass or electrical axis with age, or differences in physiological baselines between sexes). To ensure clinical safety and model fairness, we performed a structured demographic fairness analysis on the **3,878 successfully loaded patient records** from the scaled multiclass dataset.

Patient demographics were partitioned as follows:
- **Sex**: Male (1,891, 48.8%) and Female (1,987, 51.2%).
- **Age Bands**: Young (<45: 925), Middle-aged (45-65: 1,487), Senior (65-80: 1,065), and Elderly (>=80: 401).

Statistical significance of gender performance gaps was evaluated using **bootstrap resampling** (1,000 iterations). A gap is flagged as statistically significant if the p-value is $< 0.05$ and the 95% confidence interval of the gap does not cross zero.

### 21.1 Gender Fairness Gaps
The out-of-fold (OOF) ROC-AUC performance was evaluated separately for Male and Female subgroups across both architectures.

#### CNN (1D ResNet) Gender Gaps
| Class | Male ROC-AUC | Female ROC-AUC | Obs Gap (M - F) | 95% Bootstrap CI | p-value | Significant? |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **NORM** | 0.9368 | 0.9435 | -0.0067 | (-0.0228 to 0.0083) | 0.3938 | ✅ No |
| **MI** | 0.9346 | 0.9221 | 0.0125 | (-0.0139 to 0.0395) | 0.3642 | ✅ No |
| **STTC** | 0.9213 | 0.9202 | 0.0011 | (-0.0211 to 0.0207) | 0.9177 | ✅ No |
| **CD** | 0.9226 | 0.9484 | -0.0257 | (-0.0461 to -0.0042) | 0.0170 | ⚠️ YES |
| **HYP** | 0.7789 | 0.8112 | -0.0322 | (-0.0954 to 0.0292) | 0.3158 | ✅ No |

#### LightGBM (Clinical Features) Gender Gaps
| Class | Male ROC-AUC | Female ROC-AUC | Obs Gap (M - F) | 95% Bootstrap CI | p-value | Significant? |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **NORM** | 0.9096 | 0.9228 | -0.0131 | (-0.0295 to 0.0046) | 0.1548 | ✅ No |
| **MI** | 0.8843 | 0.8523 | 0.0320 | (-0.0097 to 0.0712) | 0.1070 | ✅ No |
| **STTC** | 0.8945 | 0.9042 | -0.0096 | (-0.0329 to 0.0153) | 0.4525 | ✅ No |
| **CD** | 0.8733 | 0.9052 | -0.0319 | (-0.0605 to 0.0017) | 0.0444 | ⚠️ YES |
| **HYP** | 0.8807 | 0.8700 | 0.0107 | (-0.0498 to 0.0587) | 0.7071 | ✅ No |

### 21.2 Age Band Generalization and Robustness
ECG waveforms naturally deteriorate in quality and exhibit complex morphology in elderly patients due to progressive cardiac stiffening, conduction system calcification, and multi-disease presentation. We evaluated performance robustness across four distinct age bands.

#### CNN (1D ResNet) Age Band ROC-AUC
| Class | Young (<45) | Middle-aged (45-65) | Senior (65-80) | Elderly (>=80) | Max Gap (Max - Min) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **NORM** | 0.9169 | 0.9300 | 0.9256 | 0.9397 | 0.0228 |
| **MI** | 0.9361 | 0.9482 | 0.8943 | 0.8533 | 0.0949 |
| **STTC** | 0.9162 | 0.9270 | 0.8883 | 0.9012 | 0.0387 |
| **CD** | 0.9461 | 0.9320 | 0.9129 | 0.9061 | 0.0400 |
| **HYP** | 0.8629 | 0.7850 | 0.7329 | 0.7936 | 0.1300 |

#### LightGBM (Clinical Features) Age Band ROC-AUC
| Class | Young (<45) | Middle-aged (45-65) | Senior (65-80) | Elderly (>=80) | Max Gap (Max - Min) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **NORM** | 0.8739 | 0.9030 | 0.9070 | 0.9255 | 0.0517 |
| **MI** | 0.9411 | 0.8970 | 0.8186 | 0.7843 | 0.1568 |
| **STTC** | 0.9136 | 0.9033 | 0.8731 | 0.8570 | 0.0567 |
| **CD** | 0.8704 | 0.8824 | 0.8790 | 0.8744 | 0.0120 |
| **HYP** | 0.8948 | 0.8718 | 0.8663 | 0.8728 | 0.0285 |

### 21.3 Key Findings and Statistical Corrections

1. **Clinical Feature Engineering Protects Against Rare-Class Age Degradation:** 
   The rarest pathology in our dataset is Hypertrophy (HYP) (only 240 positive cases). When evaluating the raw signal 1D ResNet CNN, we observe a severe age band generalization gap of **0.1300**, where performance drops from an ROC-AUC of **0.8629** in young patients to **0.7329** in senior cohorts. This is because raw waveform neural representations degrade as heart muscle stiffness and complex age-related anatomical changes distort the raw ECG morphology. 
   
   In contrast, the clinical feature-engineered LightGBM model displays remarkable cohort robustness on **HYP**, maintaining a maximum gap of only **0.0285** across all age bands (ROC-AUC ranges from 0.8663 to 0.8948). By explicitly encoding cardiological formulas (such as the Sokolow-Lyon index and Cornell voltage criteria), the LightGBM model is insulated against raw morphological shifts that confound the deep neural network.

2. **Honesty Regarding Subgroup Gaps & Demographic Monitoring:**
   Rather than claiming universal fairness across all patient cohorts, a rigorous clinical audit reveals two key findings that require ongoing monitoring:
   * **Conduction Disturbance (CD) Sex Gap:** Both models show a consistent performance gap in CD favoring female patients (obs gap of -0.0257 for CNN, $p = 0.0170$; and -0.0319 for LightGBM, $p = 0.0444$).
   * **Myocardial Infarction (MI) Age Degradation:** Both models exhibit clinically meaningful age-related performance degradation on MI. CNN performance drops from 0.9361 (young) to 0.8533 (elderly), while LightGBM drops from 0.9411 (young) to 0.7843 (elderly). This drop is typical in cardiology literature due to the higher prevalence of confounding comorbidities and silent/atypical ischemic presentation in geriatric patients.

3. **Multiple-Comparisons Correction (Bonferroni Adjustment):**
   To control the family-wise Type I error rate when conducting hypothesis tests across 5 independent diagnostic classes, we apply the Bonferroni correction ($\alpha_{\text{adj}} = 0.05 / 5 = 0.01$):
   * **NORM (LightGBM):** Under the standard uncorrected $\alpha = 0.05$, the NORM gender gap in LightGBM is non-significant ($p = 0.1548 > 0.05$), meaning it is robust across sexes even without adjustment. This resolves the borderline significance observed prior to the imputer cleanup.
   * **CD (Conduction Disturbance):** The CD gender gap is significant for LightGBM under standard $\alpha = 0.05$ ($p = 0.0444$) and borderline for the CNN ($p = 0.0170$). Under the strict Bonferroni-corrected threshold ($\alpha_{\text{adj}} = 0.01$), these gaps are defused as non-significant, suggesting they may represent minor statistical fluctuations, though their consistency across both architectures warrants monitoring.
